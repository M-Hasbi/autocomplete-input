"# autocomplete-input" 
 
 Here my goal is understanding of using list of first-child , last-child and th-child and while using that how input text is autocompleted by functions.
 Besides that, I also played a bit on CSS side.
 
 
 1-)Let's have a look at our mini project.

 2-)When we click on the area of input, border of input is changing into blue color.

 3-)Let's type something and see what is gonna happen.

 4-)If we slide on the list of element; firstly the background color is changing and the element that we point out is slightly moving to the left side.
 Secondly, we can move on in the list using upper and down event keys. Our mini project also contains that feature.

 5-)And finally we select our element and our element is assigning into the input type, after that our below list is gonna disappear.
